# Word-to-pdf-conversion
By Using this Code you will abale to convert word documents in pdf format with watermark and header also (image or text as per user choice) feature (can select multiple docx. file) <br>
I Use Completely Python in this, with PyQT5, i can create with Tkinter also but in my system it showing an trouble <br>
An Image or text which you are using for watermark in center is also used for header, center watermark is 30% of capacity, and the header is in right side with 1/4% of the size of center watermark and capacity is same <br>
In this code i add the logic by which the most recent image or text that you used for watermark is saved in json format for next conversion to reduce time of selecting image or text you can simply choose from drop down

# Let me know if any suggestion or any modification need in this code
